Welcome to slewpy's documentation!
==================================

slewpy is a Python package that allows the simulation of the science operations of an astrophysics space satellite mission. 
slewpy allows users to specify an astronomical target list with observing priorities and a satellite configuration 
(i.e., orbit and various satellite parameters). Taking these inputs, slewpy can be used to run a time-resolved 
simulation of an astrophysics mission and outputs simulated target observations given constraints 
such as satellite slewing rates between targets, observing time on a given target, and Sun-, Earth-, 
and Moon-limb observing constraints. slewpy provides the tools to test astrophysics space satellite mission 
designs against observing requirements for a given science case.

A good place to get started is with the installation guide, getting started page and
the the tutorial examples.
